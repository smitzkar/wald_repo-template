# Welcome to Project-Name!  

very **short** description of: 
- what it is 
- in what context it was developed

```A simple DIY "drone" streaming either live camera or infrared feed. Part of the [TechTales exhibition at UNI_VERSUM.](https://linktothething.notarealwebsite.com)```

Try to stick to 1 or 2 sentences, no more than a paragraph.

## Features (optional)

## Hardware (optional)

if your project only consists of an esp32 devboard, a potentiometer, and a raspberry pi, feel free to list them here -> immediately show what is needed / for what it is designed

```- Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3 Sense
- super duper fancy Infrared-Sensor2000
- 340mAh LiPo battery
- 22in mylar ballon (or similar)
- kite string
- optional NeoPixels or similar```

if it requires a bunch of components, put it in the documentation

## Quick Start / Documentation (optional)

if it's something super simple (a standalone arduino sketch), provide a quick description of how to get it running here  
(make sure to note any special version requirements, or such, if relevant)

if it's more complex, link to the relevant documentation. for example:
