# Welcome to Project-Name!  

very **short** description of: 
- what it is 
- in what context it was developed

```A simple DIY "drone" streaming either live camera or infrared feed. Part of the [TechTales exhibition at UNI_VERSUM.](https://linktothething.notarealwebsite.com)```

Try to stick to 1 or 2 sentences, no more than a paragraph.

## Features (optional)

## Hardware (optional)

if your project only consists of an esp32 devboard, a potentiometer, and a raspberry pi, feel free to list them here -> immediately show what is needed / for what it is designed

```
- Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3 Sense
- super duper fancy Infrared-Sensor2000
- 340mAh LiPo battery
- 22in mylar ballon (or similar)
- kite string
- optional NeoPixels or similar
```

if it requires a bunch of components, put it in the documentation

## Quick Start / Documentation (optional)

if it's something super simple (a standalone arduino sketch), provide a quick description of how to get it running here. 
if at all possible, add picture(s)! 
(make sure to note any special version requirements, or such, if relevant)

``` 
Only works with Arduino IDE >= 2.13 !

- Connect the camera module to the ESP32 as described here: [link]
- Copy the src folder to your computer and open the sketch in Arduino IDE. 
- Make sure to install somerandomlibrary
- Set your own WiFi credentials
- Compile and Upload 
- Open browser and enjoy!
