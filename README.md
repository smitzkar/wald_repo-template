# wald_repo-template
Empty template for structure


## How to fill it

### general folder structure: 

#### Dependent on project:
docs        = images, videos, build-guide, how-to, extra text or pdf files, etc. 
hardware    = 3d-print files, schematics, etc. 
src         = all code and stuff used by code (just use whatever sub-structure you want or what your IDE gave you)

#### Required: 
README.md   = quick overview of the project, include relevant links, if not immediately obvious explain how to read/use the repo (see README-template.md)
LICENCE     = MIT ? 

### markdown basics: 
(no google docs or word or such, please)
